		<p class="txt">With this cookie policy, we wish to inform you about the use of cookies or similar storage technologies (hereinafter “cookies”) on this website.</p>
		<h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
		<p class="txt">Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your device to save certain information or image files, such as pixels. The next time you visit our website on the same device, the information saved in the cookies will subsequently be transmitted either to our website (“First Party Cookie”) or to another website to which the cookie belongs (“Third Party Cookie”).</p>

We use this information to be able to design and display the website in an optimum way in line with your preferences.</p>
		<p class="txt">In that respect, only the cookie itself is identified on your device. Beyond this extent, your personal data will only be saved upon your express consent or if it is strictly necessary to be able to use the service offered to and accessed by you accordingly.</p>
		<h2>Consent to the use of Cookies</h2>
		<p class="txt">Cookies that are not strictly necessary to make the services available on our website are only used when you provide us with your consent. As soon as you actively accept the use of cookies via the cookie banner on our website, you consent to the use of cookies.</p>
		<p class="txt">You can, of course, customize your cookie settings at any time, for example by activating or deactivating individual cookie categories.</p>

		<h2>Legal Basis</h2>
		<p class="txt">Where you have provided consent to the use of cookies on the basis of a notice (Cookie banner) displayed on our websites (“cookies banner”), the legality of this data processing is governed by Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. Where consent is not requested, the legal basis for the use of these functional cookies is a legitimate interest (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of the website and services) within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).</p>
		<h2>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h2>
		<p class="txt">Strictly necessary cookies guarantee functions without which you cannot use this web page and service as intended. These cookies are used exclusively by this website and are therefore first party cookies. This means that all information stored in the cookies will be returned to this website.</p>
		<h2>Performance Cookies</h2>
		<p class="txt">Performance cookies collect information about how our websites are used in order to improve their attractiveness, content and functionality. These cookies help us, for example, to determine whether and which subpages of our website are visited and in which content you are particularly interested. In particular, we record the number of visits to a page, the number of subpages accessed, the time spent on our website, the order of the pages visited, which search terms led you to us, the country, region and, if applicable, the city from which access has been made, and the proportion of mobile devices accessing our websites. The IP address of your computer, that is transmitted for technical reasons, is also automatically anonymized and does not allow us to draw any conclusions about you, as an individual user.</p>
